Hello, my name is Emory and I'm currently a Sophomore at Cal Poly SLO majoring in Computer Engineering.
    I'm currently taking courses on digital design and project-based object-oriented programming and I've worked with Python and Java.
    I'm interested in gaining more experience with practical projects and expanding my skillset.
